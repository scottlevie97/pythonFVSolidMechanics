    "##### Spatial Variation\n",
    "Spatial variation is a key assumption in the finite volume method. It stems from the definition of the centroid rule; where for a volume $V$ the centroid of said volume $\\boldsymbol{\\textrm{x}}_P$ is given by the equation:\n",

    "\n",
    "<!-- ** try explain this with moments?: The centroid is the location within a volume of constant density where the total moments are zero ** -->\n",
    "\n",
    "The spatial variation for our solver assumes that all intensive properties $\\phi$ vary linearly within the CV with distance from the centroid. \n",
    "\n",
    "This raises some questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is an intensive property?** They are properties that are independent of the amount of matter within a system. Examples are density (mass per volume) and velocity (momentum per unit mass). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What does varying linearly mean?** This means that the change of intensive property from the value at the centroid will be directly proportional to the distance from the centroid:\n",
